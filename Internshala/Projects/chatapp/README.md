As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, GitHub does not publicly disclose specific commit count thresholds associated with each color on the contribution heatmap. The color intensity is more qualitative and provides a visual representation of the user's activity without precise numeric values.

However, you can make general observations based on the typical level of activity associated with each color:

1. **Light Green (Low Activity):**
   - This might represent a day with a small number of commits, perhaps less than 5 or 10.
   - It indicates relatively low activity, such as minor code changes or a small contribution.

2. **Medium Green (Moderate Activity):**
   - A moderate level of activity may involve a noticeable increase in commits, ranging from around 10 to 20 or more.
   - Users may have worked on multiple features, fixed bugs, or made substantial contributions.

3. **Dark Green (High Activity):**
   - Dark green squares represent days with a high level of activity.
   - This could involve a significant number of commits, perhaps exceeding 20 or 30.
   - It suggests substantial contributions, possibly involving major feature development or extensive code changes.

4. **Darkest Green (Very High Activity):**
   - The darkest green squares indicate exceptionally high activity.
   - This could involve a large number of commits, potentially exceeding 50 or more.
   - It suggests an intense day of development with extensive work on multiple fronts.

It's important to note that these are general estimations based on common practices, and the actual thresholds might vary. GitHub's color scheme is designed to provide a quick visual overview rather than precise quantification. Additionally, GitHub may update or adjust these color thresholds over time. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's recommended to refer to GitHub's official documentation or announcements.
